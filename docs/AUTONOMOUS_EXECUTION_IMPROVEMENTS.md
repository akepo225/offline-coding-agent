# Autonomous Execution Improvements

## Problem
The assistant was not autonomous - it would execute one tool and stop, even when multi-step tasks required reading a file, processing it, and writing output.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (`working_assistant.py:380-417`)
- Explicitly instructs the model to be **autonomous** and complete **multi-step tasks**
- Provides examples of multi-step operations:
  - Read file â†’ Write summary
  - Create multiple directories + README
  - Read config â†’ Modify â†’ Write back
- Emphasizes: "DO NOT explain what you WILL do - JUST DO IT"

### 2. Autonomous Feedback Loop (`working_assistant.py:432-483`)
Based on Google ADK Loop Agent patterns:

**Loop Structure:**
```
Iteration 1: Generate response â†’ Execute tools
Iteration 2: Feed results back â†’ Continue with next steps
Stop when: No more tools OR max iterations reached
```

**Key Features:**
- **Max 2 iterations**: Initial response + one follow-up (prevents timeouts)
- **Concise feedback**: Only essential data fed back to model
- **Smart termination**: Stops when no tools are called (task complete)
- **Progress indicators**: Shows "ðŸ”„ Step 2..." when continuing

**Feedback Format:**
```
Results: read_file: [content preview] | write_file: Done
Complete remaining steps.
```

### 3. Termination Conditions (Based on ADK Best Practices)
1. **No tool calls** â†’ Task is complete
2. **Max iterations reached** â†’ Prevents infinite loops
3. **Explicit exit** â†’ Break when appropriate

## Example: Multi-Step Task

**User Request:**
"Read test_aider.py and write a summary to test_aider_summary.md"

**Autonomous Execution:**
1. **Step 1**: `[TOOL: read_file(file_path='test_aider.py')]`
   - Executes, returns file content
2. **Step 2** (automatic): `[TOOL: write_file(file_path='test_aider_summary.md', content='Summary...')]`
   - Uses content from step 1
   - Completes task
3. **Stop**: No more tools needed

## Key Improvements

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Single tool execution | Multi-step autonomous execution |
| No feedback loop | Tool results fed back to model |
| No continuation mechanism | Automatic continuation for complex tasks |
| Manual chaining required | Automatic task decomposition |

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Limited iterations** (2 max) - Prevents timeouts on slow hardware
2. **Concise feedback** - Reduces token usage and processing time
3. **Early termination** - Stops as soon as task is complete
4. **Content preview** - Only sends first 150 chars of long content

## Usage

The improvements are automatic - just ask for multi-step tasks:

```bash
./start_assistant.sh

# Examples that now work autonomously:
"Read config.yaml and create a backup in backups/config.bak"
"Create src/ and tests/ directories and add a README.md"
"Summarize main.py and write the summary to docs/main_summary.md"
```
